Possible Dataset to Expand the Model
-----

We have considered the following dataset to conduct our research, we are currently only using the open dataset from KAggle, however, some of the following datasets 
can be used if we want to expand our model and more data is required.

| Database Name  | Samples | Expression distribution | URL | Comments  |
| -------------- |:-------:|:-----------------------:|-----|:---------:|
| FER-2013 | 35,887 images | 6 basic expressions plus neutral | https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge | (using) Open Dataset |
| ExpW | 91,793 images | 6 basic expressions plus neutral | http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/socialrelation/index.html | Access Request Required |
| AffectNet | 450,000 images (labeled)| 6 basic expressions plus neutral | http://mohammadmahoor.com/databases-codes/ | Access Request Required |
